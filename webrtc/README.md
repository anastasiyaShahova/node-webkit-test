# NodeWebkit WebRTC Demo

## Features

1. P2P video & audio streaming with one signal server ( websocket ).
2. Use native APIs only.
3. Currently it's still a one-to-one RTC application, but a many-to-many version is possible and not too difficult.
4. Meaningful project structure with somewhat chaotical code.

## To Install

1. `make`

## To Test

1. Fill your target's ID in the first input element
2. Press the "Start" button to register on the signal server
3. After your target also get started, press the "Call" button
4. In theory it's bidirection. One can call others can also be called.
